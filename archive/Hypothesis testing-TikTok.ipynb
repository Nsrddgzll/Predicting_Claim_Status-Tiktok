    "In this lap, we will explore the data provided and conduct a hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis** testing is a method we use in statistics to figure out if what we're seeing in our data is just a fluke or if it's something real we can actually trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, we start with what we call hypotheses. Think of these like two different ideas we're testing. One is called the null hypothesis, which basically says there's no real effect or difference going on. It's like saying things are just normal, nothing special. Then, we have the alternative hypothesis, which is what we're hoping to find evidence for. This one says there is some kind of effect or difference happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to decide how sure we want to be before we make any conclusions. We set something called the significance level, often written as `α`. It's like setting a bar – if we find evidence that's higher than this bar, we'll believe there's something going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we pick a statistic to help us make our decision. This depends on what kind of data we have and what question we're trying to answer. There are different tests for different situations, like t-tests, chi-square tests, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our data, we crunch some numbers to calculate our chosen statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the fun part – we compare what we found to what we expected. We look at our calculated statistic and see if it's big enough to cross into what we call the critical region. This is like our danger zone – if our statistic lands here, it means we should start to doubt our null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we make a call based on where our statistic ended up. If it's in the critical region, we reject the null hypothesis and say, \"Hey, there's something interesting going on here!\" If it's not in the critical region, we don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis – so we stick with the idea that things are just normal."

    "It represents the maximum expected difference between the true population parameter and a sample estimate.\n",

    "After calculating the t-statistic, you compare it to a critical value from the t-distribution table (based on your chosen significance level and degrees of freedom) to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. If the absolute value of the t-statistic is greater than the critical value, you reject the null hypothesis.\n",
